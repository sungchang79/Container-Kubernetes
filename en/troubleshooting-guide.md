## Container > Kubernetes > Troubleshooting Guide

This guide explains how to solve various problems that you might encounter while using the Kubernetes service.

### > Disk space is reduced as the size of the worker node's container log file increases.

#### Set log rotation
For container log file management (setting the maximum file size, the number of log files, and so on), add the following setting to the worker node.

```
$ sudo bash -c "cat > /etc/logrotate.d/docker" <<EOF
/var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log {
    rotate 10
    copytruncate
    missingok
    notifempty
    compress
    maxsize 100M
    daily
    dateext
    dateformat -%Y%m%d-%s
    create 0644 root root
}
EOF
```

In the worker node, container log rotation based on the setting above is performed through cron at around 3 AM every day.

> [Note] For instance images later than `CentOS 7.8 - Container (2021.07.27)`, the log rotation setting as above is provided by default.

#### Synchronize log rotation setting

While operating clusters, log rotation setting for some of the worker nodes might change in the following cases:
  * When the instance images are different between node groups
    * Node based on images with log rotation setting applied vs. unapplied
  * When the setting is added directly to the node based on images with log rotation setting unapplied
    * New node added by cluster auto scaler or node group size adjustment vs. existing node
  * When the log rotation setting details are changed and applied directly
    * New node added by cluster auto scaler or node group size adjustment vs. existing node

To keep the log rotation setting consistent for all worker nodes in the circumstances above, you can consider the following method for synchronization.

##### ```Synchronize the log rotation setting file via SSH```

The code shown below is the shell commands to create a script that compares the log rotation setting file for the cluster's all worker nodes based on SSH, and copies the file to the nodes that require the setting.

The following are the prerequisites for executing the commands.

* Open SSH port for the worker node (open TCP port 22 from the security group)
* The key pair file that was used to create the worker node
* The kubectl binary
* The kubeconfig file for the target cluster
* The logrotate setting file to be used as the synchronization source

You need to modify the first parameter of 3 cp commands before running the commands.<br>
A synchronization task is performed every midnight using the shell script and cron job generated after the command execution is completed.
